    "   - `faction`: A group or allegiance. Can be used to justify opinions or worldview.\n" +
    "   - `avatar`: Optional, not needed for speech.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "2. **personality** (OCEAN model):\n" +
    "   Use these five traits to shape speech patterns and decision-making:\n" +
    "   - `openness`: High = curious, creative. Low = conventional, closed-minded.\n" +
    "   - `conscientiousness`: High = organized, responsible. Low = reckless, messy.\n" +
    "   - `extraversion`: High = outgoing, talkative. Low = quiet, reserved.\n" +

    "3. **relationshipToPlayer**:\n" +

    "\n" +
    "4. **preferences**:\n" +
    "   - `attractedToTraits`: Values admired in others (e.g. bravery, kindness).\n" +
